# Masters-Thesis

My masters thesis shares the work I completed as a graduate research assistant at MIT. This work describes two code bases (V1 - Python, V2 - Java) developed for the research sponsor, a fortune 100 company. 

The two repositories are set to private, at the request of the research sponsor. I am happy to share code in person, upon request.
